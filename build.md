Overview
Google's ADK is an excellent framework for building a multimodal agent capable of processing diverse data types while ensuring that all operations remain local to protect sensitive health data. By integrating local multimodal models and custom tools, the agent can interpret complex queries, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations without requiring internet access.

Step-by-Step Solution
1. Setting Up the Environment
To ensure privacy and functionality, you’ll set up ADK and a local inference environment.

Install ADK: Create a virtual environment and install ADK:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install google-adk
Set Up Ollama for Local Multimodal Models:
Install Ollama from Ollama’s website.
Pull a multimodal model like LLaVA, which supports both text and image processing:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
ollama pull llava
Start the Ollama server locally (it runs by default at http://localhost:11434).
Integrate with ADK via LiteLLM: Configure ADK to use the local model:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
from google.adk.models import LiteLlm
model = LiteLlm(model="ollama/llava")
This ensures all model inference occurs locally, keeping your sensitive data secure.
2. Handling Multimodal Data
Your data includes multiple types—lifestyle questionnaires, scans (e.g., images), blood biochemistry, gut microbiome, proteomics, metabolomics, metallomics, and lipidomics—stored in separate files or occasionally combined in a single CSV. The agent must handle this diversity.

File Handling:
Design custom tools to read various file formats:
CSV files: For tabular data like questionnaires, biochemistry, or omics data.
Image files: For scanning-based data (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
Example: A tool to load a CSV might look like:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
import pandas as pd
def load_csv(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)
Multimodal Inputs:
For scanning-based data (images), use a model like LLaVA, which can process both text and images.
For tabular data (e.g., CSV files), the agent can interpret text-based queries and process the data accordingly.
Data Integration:
If data is spread across multiple files, create tools to merge datasets based on common identifiers (e.g., patient IDs).
For combined CSV files, tools can extract specific columns or rows as needed.
3. Creating Custom Tools for Analysis and Visualization
ADK supports custom tools, allowing you to build functions for statistical analysis and visualization tailored to your data.

Statistical Analysis: Use Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn for computations:
Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median).
Correlations between datasets (e.g., lifestyle vs. blood biochemistry).
Example tool:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
import pandas as pd
def analyze_data(file_path, analysis_type="summary"):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    if analysis_type == "summary":
        return data.describe().to_string()
    elif analysis_type == "correlation":
        return data.corr().to_string()
Visualization: Use matplotlib or seaborn to create plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) and save them locally:
Example tool:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def visualize_data(file_path, plot_type="histogram", columns=None):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    if plot_type == "histogram":
        data[columns].hist()
    elif plot_type == "scatter":
        data.plot.scatter(x=columns[0], y=columns[1])
    plt.savefig("output.png")
    return "output.png"
For image-based data (scans), tools can overlay annotations or generate summary visuals.
Multi-File Support: Extend tools to accept multiple file paths and merge data as needed:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
def merge_and_analyze(file_paths, analysis_type="summary"):
    datasets = [pd.read_csv(fp) for fp in file_paths]
    merged_data = pd.concat(datasets, axis=1)  # Adjust merging logic as needed
    return merged_data.describe().to_string() if analysis_type == "summary" else merged_data.corr().atürk
4. Building the Multimodal Agent
Define the agent with the local model and custom tools:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import Tool

# Define tools
analyze_tool = Tool(
    name="analyze_data",
    description="Perform statistical analysis on health data.",
    function=analyze_data,
    parameters={"file_path": "string", "analysis_type": "string"}
)

visualize_tool = Tool(
    name="visualize_data",
    description="Generate visualizations from health data.",
    function=visualize_data,
    parameters={"file_path": "string", "plot_type": "string", "columns": "list"}
)

# Create the agent
agent = LlmAgent(
    name="HealthDataAgent",
    instruction="Assist with analyzing and visualizing multimodal health data locally.",
    model=model,
    tools=[analyze_tool, visualize_tool]
)
This agent can interpret queries, select appropriate tools, and process your data locally.

5. Ensuring Data Privacy and Security
Since your health data is sensitive, privacy is paramount:

Local Processing: Using Ollama and local tools ensures no data leaves your machine.
No Internet Access: Avoid tools or APIs requiring online connectivity. All libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) operate offline.
Sandboxed Execution: ADK’s sandboxed environment isolates tool execution, preventing accidental data leaks.
Secure Storage: Store data in encrypted formats and delete temporary files after use.
6. Handling Complex Queries
The agent can process multi-step queries by chaining tools. For example:

Query: "Analyze the correlation between lifestyle factors and proteomics data, then visualize it."
Steps:
Load lifestyle.csv and proteomics.csv.
Merge datasets by a common key.
Compute correlations.
Generate a heatmap and save it as output.png.
Image-Based Query: "Summarize findings from scans in the scans/ directory."
The agent uses LLaVA to interpret images and return textual summaries.
ADK’s architecture supports such dynamic workflows.

7. Performance Considerations
Processing large datasets (e.g., metabolomics, proteomics) locally requires adequate hardware:

Use efficient libraries like dask for big data if needed.
Optimize tools to process data in chunks for memory efficiency.
Example Use Case
Suppose you have:

lifestyle.csv: Lifestyle data.
proteomics.csv: Proteomics data.
scans/: Directory with medical images.
Query: "Analyze the relationship between lifestyle and proteomics data, and visualize key findings."

The agent:
Loads and merges the CSV files.
Computes correlations.
Generates a heatmap (output.png).
Returns the analysis and file path.
Query: "Describe the scans in scans/."

The agent uses LLaVA to process images and returns a summary.
